      "Kanishk is one of those initial people who acted as a brick in the foundation on which the club stands strong today. I still remember a thin, innocent-looking boy walking into sessions wearing a cap, alongside his chaddi buddy Aditya, carrying just one notebook and a pen. A nervous kid who knew nothing about debating but there was a spark in his eyes. A spark to voice the thoughts running wild in his mind. A spark to engage in political discussions, to learn to evolve and that very spark pushed him to break his boundaries and fit so effortlessly into this space. He's a guy with clarity of thought someone who knows how to put his ideas on the table and get things done. A proper jugaadu fellow who will make sure that, come what may, the work gets done by hook or crook. Approachable understanding, and sharp, Kanishk has handled some of the most crucial moments of the SoC and always stepped up with maturity and grace. Over the time he has proved himself, his capabilities and I have no doubt that under his leadership, SoC will witness revolutions, bold decisions, and milestones that win shape a better and brighter future for the club.",

As one of the finest adjudicators in the soc, his feedback both within debates and beyond, has been among the most valuable anvone could receive.He's not just someone who gets things done; he leads by example and pushes others to do better. In this new cabinet, Adi will continue to be the rock he's always been someone who holds things together and raises the bar, just like he always has.",

      "From being the operational coordinator to being the operational head now, dhruv has always proved himself.We've pulled off so many events together, he's practically become my little baby brother. And a very smart, very competitive baby brother at that! And don't let that sweet, innocent face fool you for a second. Underneath that lies a brain so awe- inspiring, it's terrifying sometimes. He is basically a fountain of information.Trying to win an argument against him is like bringing a spoon to a sword fight! But here's the best part, apart from his terrifying intellect, he's also the best listener. He is someone who you can go speak to about anything (professional or personal) and he is always ready to listen. Honestly, we couldn't have asked for anyone better for this role , and I hope only the best finds you!!",

And not to forget he is an amazing photographer.He is a person who shares his knowledge with immense patience, ensuring u feel comfortable asking any question without the fear of judgement. Let's not forget how because of him we had our first ever break in BITS Goa and how proud he has made the SMVIT Debsoc. He is a person with great potential to achieve greater things , and I am incredibly proud of him. And with such great responsibility I am pretty sure he is going to change the lynamics of the soc to a new level.",

      "A fun, chaotic drama queen and of course, a phenomenal debater.Prachi is one of those people in the SoC who started from the ground and rose into a beast. From struggling to build a case in her early days to now single-handedly framing arguments and 'putting her opp out of the debate'. Her growth has been nothing short of inspiring. From knowing nothing about IR or politics to now having such deep insights that she can confidently take workshops. She's come a long way.With an attitude of 'masti nahi rukni chahiye,' her ability to add humor in the most intense discussions while slaying tournaments is something only Prachi can pull off. The opposition is cooked the moment she says 'understand that' twice within the first minute of her speech and you know it's game over. Her grasp on debates and her connection with every person in the SoC is unmatched. Whether it's taking initiative, training juniors for tournaments, or conducting sessions she's everything you'd want in a leader.With her in the cabinet, even the biggest bumps are handled with laughter and ease.",

He has a unique way of looking at things and his ability to dissect complex topics and present them clearly is commendable. This skill also lead him to being the 5th best team in RCL PD 24.Not only in debating, but he is always ready to help soc whenever needed. I do recall swinging with him, whether its Axiom or PD with the same utmost enthusiasm. This entire persona of his is what an ideal equity head should be like. He is always ready to help, always ready to listen, and break down complex issues into easy solutions. Keep up the great work, Owais!",
